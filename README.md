# M1 DV3: Shoot
In this assignment we created movement logic for the player and camera. We also gave the pickup features and created a enemy with the ability to detect the player.

This build includes an extra feature I thought up. Pressing Right click on the mouse while the player is in the air will create a slow moving platform underneath the player. That is the secret to getting all four capsules.
